## Foreword

The necessity of a document outlining the form and function of which Keiretsu is supposed to take is arguable. But as we grow into a much larger organization, it is becoming more of a necessity to clearly outline what we can or cannot do as well as the processses we can use in order to amend what is written in times where it is needed.

It is not the intent of this document to be read out to every staff member. Instead, this will be used to strictly turn solely *de facto* into *de jure* as well and leave out any ambiguity as much as possible.

Also about time we update the stuff in the info channel anyway...

## Form

Keiretsu is a **staff group**. Its main objective is to:
1. Set a basic standard for all work.
2. Increase the skill ceiling for each role through the sharing of information.
3. Provide staff for series managed by a release group.
4. Ensure that staff rights are respected.
5. Recruit and integrate as much people as possible while maintaining the basic standard.
6. Expand as far as the number of staff can allow it.

Keiretsu-affiliated **release groups**, led by group leaders, will exclusively distribute series produced by Keiretsu staff. These groups function as effective subsidiaries of Keiretsu.

Keiretsu's direction is primarily led by a head. Matters related to the management of this Discord server is at the sole discretion of the Keiretsu head or any authorized advisor provided that it will lead to uniformity and/or efficiency.

The head may be assisted or urged by appointed advisors which have distinguished themselves to be a help to the group, formerly Department Leads; and group leaders of release groups staffed by Keiretsu.

## Rights

Staff and Group Leaders have basic rights relating to their stay in Keiretsu.

Full staff are entitled to:
1. Receive full credit for their work in any published Keiretsu-affiliated project*. This includes, but is not limited to, custom graphics, fully or partially completed chapter content, style guides, and other creative or editorial materials.
2. Work on only what they want to work on.
3. Claim *dibs* on a series, provided they are able to finish their work on time.
4. Withdraw from working on anything at any time, provided they give notice.
5. Retire (or go on hiatus) and return with their previous qualifications intact.
6. Stay in Keiretsu for as long as they want, regardless of activity.

*Credit placement (e.g., at the beginning, end, or elsewhere within the work) will follow the general style of the series, unless otherwise agreed upon with the contributor in advance.

Probationary staff are entitled to Full Staff rights from one (1) to three (4), with the exception of an activity quota of at least one published work per month until they are elevated to full status. Their stay in Keiretsu is at the discretion of the Keiretsu head, advisors, or group leaders, in that order.

Group leaders are entitled to:
1. Leave Keiretsu at any time.
2. Maintain *ownership* of their series, even as they leave Keiretsu as a matter of professional courtesy. Keiretsu will not be allowed to work on a series of a former release group without the permission of the current group lead.
3. Advise and urge the Keiretsu head to revise policy, recruit, or anything related to the management of the group in general.
4. Pick up any series provided that a full set of staff are willing to work on the series beforehand.

## Recruitment and Acquisition/Absorption

As one of the main principles of Keiretsu, it is of utmost importance that expansion is taken into account and is prioritized.

Recruitment of prospective staff will be done by the Keiretsu head, advisors, and group leaders. Screening will be done and essentially required before admission into the group.

For inexperienced applicants, feedback and guidance will be given as much as possible by any volunteers as to help them achieve the basic standard expected of their role. 

For experienced applicants, tests may be required of them if prior works are not deemed sufficient to ascertain their skill.

The acquisition or absorption of other release groups outside of Keiretsu is as follows:

For groups originating inside of Keiretsu (groups that are created by current staff), they will be allowed to integrate directly provided that they are able to staff their series consistently and are able to recruit more applicants into joining Keiretsu as staff.

For groups originating outside of Keiretsu, they will be required to enter their qualified staff members into the group formally, as well as formally declare that they (and other group lead/s, if necessary) are the sole members of their release group. This allows for the complete integration of staff into Keiretsu and formalize the relationship and duty of Keiretsu to efficiently provide staff for their series.

Ultimately, the decision lies with the Keiretsu head if and ever a group is allowed to join the system. To date, no group has been refused.
