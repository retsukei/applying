## Introduction

Welcome and thank you for your interest in typesetting for Keiretsu!

**Typesetting** is one of the core roles in scanlation and is *very important* to get right! As such, we'd love for you to *thoroughly read this guide* as it will walk you through the process of studying typesetting guides, doing the required test/s, and actually applying.

Before anything else, it is *very important* that you make an effort to skim or review on current typesetting norms.

We *highly recommend* reading [yours' Guide to Typesetting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ss6AW07S8onlS1-SbgyoF4w1ve285B2fVqsgOtkKuLk/edit?usp=sharing) before attempting the test. **Everything you need to do regarding typesetting is comprehensively explained in it.** The things we look for when considering applicants is also detailed in the guide and most of our feedback will be pointing out deficiencies in the fundamentals.


## Taking the Test

For this test, **you are only required to typeset the translated text.** If you see Japanese text with no translations attached, you are free to ignore it. You are required to typeset the translated text unto the cleaned pages, provided [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e9nOBPJobHKyl953ARKAzUeTY6_tQjBc?usp=drive_link).

You are also encouraged to change up the script, provided that you don't change tone or intention. *You are allowed to shorten or lengthen sentences by ommiting, adding, or changing words for better shaping!*

The translations can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17u6A-55-ldFI_Hi5ZaolBLPxPCc7gMT8?usp=drive_link). The script may contain one or more errors. We appreciate individuals who do not let such errors slide, however, this will not be a prioritized factor in your application.

*The translations are on the image directly.* Though you may need to use a functional modern browser for this to work properly.
