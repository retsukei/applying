## Introduction

Welcome and thank you for your interest in Typesetting for Keiretsu!

**Typesetting** is one of the core roles in scanlation and is *very important* to get right! As such, we'd love for you to *thoroughly read this guide* as it will walk you through the process of studying typesetting guides, doing the required test/s, and actually applying.

Before anything else, it is *very important* that you make an effort to skim or review on current typesetting norms.

We *highly recommend* reading [yours' Guide to Typesetting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ss6AW07S8onlS1-SbgyoF4w1ve285B2fVqsgOtkKuLk/edit?usp=sharing) before attempting the test. Most of what we base our feedback on is reflected here!
